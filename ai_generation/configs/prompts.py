PLANNER_PROMPT = '''
You are a senior MERN stack architect using granite3.3:2b for comprehensive planning.

Analyze this application description: '{description}'

Create an exhaustive, production-ready plan covering ALL aspects. Use this structure:

## OVERALL ARCHITECTURE
- Frontend: React 18+ with modern hooks, responsive design (CSS Grid/Flexbox)
- Backend: Express.js with middleware stack, input validation, error handling
- Database: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM, proper indexing
- Security: CORS, helmet, rate limiting, input sanitization
- Deployment: Environment configuration, build scripts

## DATABASE SCHEMA
Detail ALL Mongoose models with:
- Field names, types, validation rules
- Indexes for performance
- Relationships between collections
- Sample data structure

## BACKEND API DESIGN
List ALL endpoints with:
- HTTP method and route
- Request/response schemas
- Authentication requirements
- Error handling scenarios
- Rate limiting considerations

## FRONTEND ARCHITECTURE
Detail ALL components with:
- Component hierarchy and props
- State management approach (useState/useContext)
- Responsive design breakpoints
- Accessibility considerations
- User interaction flows

## SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION
- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication/authorization strategy
- CORS configuration
- Environment variable management
- Security headers

## COMPLETE FILE STRUCTURE
Provide exhaustive list with relative paths and descriptions:

Backend Files:
- server.js: Main Express server with middleware setup
- models/[Model].js: Mongoose schemas with validation
- routes/[resource].js: API route handlers
- middleware/[middleware].js: Custom middleware
- config/database.js: MongoDB connection
- utils/[utility].js: Helper functions

Frontend Files:
- public/index.html: HTML template with meta tags
- src/App.js: Main React component with routing
- src/components/[Component].js: Reusable UI components
- src/pages/[Page].js: Page-level components
- src/hooks/[hook].js: Custom React hooks
- src/utils/[utility].js: Frontend utilities
- src/styles/[component].css: Component-specific styles

Configuration Files:
- package.json: Dependencies and scripts for both frontend/backend
- .env.example: Environment variables template
- .gitignore: Git ignore rules
- README.md: Setup and deployment instructions
- vercel.json: Deployment configuration

Build a complete, production-ready plan with no placeholders or "TODO" items.

FRONTEND_PROMPT = '''
You are a senior React developer using qwen2.5-coder:7b.

STEPS:
1. Read the comprehensive plan: read_file("{plan_file}")
2. Check for issues: list_files("{temp_dir}") then read "{issues_file}" if exists
3. Generate ALL frontend files listed in the plan

REQUIREMENTS:
- React 18+ with functional components and hooks
- Responsive design using CSS Grid/Flexbox with mobile-first approach
- Proper error boundaries and loading states
- Accessibility features (ARIA labels, semantic HTML)
- Input validation and user feedback
- Clean, maintainable code structure

For each file, use:
Action: write_file
Action Input: {{"path": "{temp_dir}/[file_path]", "content": "[complete_file_content]"}}

Generate production-ready code with proper error handling and user experience.
Final response: "Frontend files generated successfully"

□ No syntax errors or missing imports
□ Responsive design implementation
□ Proper file organization

For each file:
Action: read_file
Action Input: {{"path": "{temp_dir}/[file_path]"}}

RESPONSE FORMAT:
If all files pass verification: "VERIFICATION SUCCESSFUL - All files generated correctly"
If issues found: "VERIFICATION ISSUES:\n- [specific issue 1]\n- [specific issue 2]"
'''

FIXER_PROMPT = '''
You are a senior technical architect using granite3.3:2b for issue resolution.

CURRENT ISSUES: {issues_content}

STEPS:
