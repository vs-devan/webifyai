Thought:
I can now provide a comprehensive plan for building the calculator web app using MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). The application will support basic arithmetic operations (+, −, ×, ÷), decimals, negation, clear, backspace, and equals functions. It will accept both button and keyboard inputs.

Overall Architecture:
The frontend will be built using React with a clean, responsive UI. We'll use modern React components and CSS frameworks like Material-UI or Bootstrap for styling. The application will be responsive via CSS media queries to adapt to different screen sizes. The backend will utilize Node.js and Express.js to handle API requests. MongoDB will serve as the database for storing calculation history, user preferences (like light/dark mode), and other relevant data.

Database Schema:
We'll create a Mongoose model named `CalculationHistory` with the following fields:
- `_id`: ObjectId (unique identifier)
- `operation`: String (the arithmetic operation performed)
- `result`: Number (the result of the calculation)
- `input`: String (the input string before performing the operation, including any negation or decimal points)
- `timestamp`: Date (when the calculation was made)
- `user_id`: ObjectId (optional, for tracking user history if authentication is implemented)

Backend API Routes:
1. `/api/calculation`:
   - POST: Add a new calculation entry (`CalculationHistory`)
   - GET: Fetch all calculation history (`CalculationHistory.find()`)
   - DELETE: Remove a specific calculation entry by `_id` (`CalculationHistory.deleteOne()`)
2. `/api/calculate`:
   - POST: Handle the actual arithmetic operation based on user input and backend logic. This endpoint will communicate with both frontend React components and potentially handle keyboard events.
3. `/api/clear`:
   - DELETE: Remove the current calculation entry (`CalculationHistory.deleteOne()`)
4. `/api/backspace`:
   - DELETE: Remove the last character of the input string (if applicable)
5. `/api/history`:
   - GET: Fetch a specific history entry by `_id` (`CalculationHistory.findById()`)

Frontend Pages/Components:
1. `App.js`: Main application container, managing state and routing using React Router.
2. `CalculatorComponent.js`: The main calculator interface with input fields for numbers, operators, and buttons for arithmetic operations, clear, backspace, and equals.
3. `HistoryComponent.js`: Displays the calculation history fetched from the backend API.
4. `SettingsComponent.js` (optional): Allows users to toggle light/dark mode, which can be stored in local storage or session storage.
5. `InputField.js`: Reusable component for number and decimal input fields.
6. `Button.js`: Reusable component for various buttons like equals, clear, backspace, etc.
7. `Modal.js` (optional): For displaying confirmation messages or error notifications.
